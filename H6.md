###### WiFi

# B) 
- During recent exercises in Wi‑Fi security challenges, I observed and attempted tasks that I had previously only seen demonstrated by others. This was my first time actively performing the steps myself, rather than following along passively.


### Key Learning
- The main takeaway for me was not just discovering new tools like **wacker**, but actually learning how to use them in practice.  
- I realized how challenging it is to piece together all the steps without direct guidance.  
- Tutorials and demonstrations often make the process look simple, but performing each stage independently requires much more training and confidence.  
- My closest ally during these exercises was **trial and error**: I had to repeat commands, adjust configurations, and troubleshoot unexpected errors multiple times.  
- If I were to repeat these tasks again, I would probably struggle almost as much as the first time. The workflow is not yet intuitive, and it’s easy to lose track of the sequence of actions.  
- Still, I believe that with repetition, the process will become more natural. As the saying goes: *practice makes perfect*.


I have also never used **“wacker”**.

It was somewhat easy to brute‑force WPA3, which I did not expect.

# C) 
I haven’t trusted Wi‑Fi for a long time. That’s why almost everything goes through cable at my place.  
If not, there is a good reason and precautions taken to make sure that it is not a leverage point to my network.
