i Registered on to lab.wifichallenge.com.
and did the challenges as such


## Introduction
- First I had to download the vm for the challenges
- Installed it
bash
sudo cat /root/flag.txt

- success.

## Recon

In the recon phase, we have four challenges. The goal is to **collect information about the Wi-Fi networks and clients**, like channels, MAC addresses, probes, and hidden ESSIDs, which are needed for further analysis or testing.

---

### 01. What is the channel that the wifi-global Access Point is currently using?
- We create a directory to **store all scan outputs in one place**:
bash
mkdir ~/wifi

- Start scanning for nearby Wi-Fi networks. We use `airmon-ng` to enable monitor mode, which allows us to **passively capture Wi-Fi traffic**, and `airodump-ng` to list all networks:
bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w ~/wifi/scan --manufacturer --wps --band abg

- By looking at the output, we can see the **channel** that the wifi-global AP is using (CH44 in this case). This is important because **we need to monitor the correct channel to see packets from this network**.

### 02. What is the MAC of the wifi-IT client?
- First, check the **channel of the target network** (wifi-IT) because monitoring the wrong channel will not show its clients.  
- The channel is **11**.

bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w ~/wifi/scanc11 --manufacturer --wps -c11

- Sample output shows BSSIDs and stations (clients). **We are looking for the MAC of the client connected to wifi-IT**.  

| BSSID | STATION | PWR | Rate | Lost | Frames | Probes |
|-------|---------|-----|------|------|--------|--------|
| ...   | ...     | ... | ...  | ...  | ...    | ...    |

- The important point here: the MAC of the client is in the **STATION column** under the network we are targeting.  

---

### 03. What is the probe of 78:C1:A7:BF:72:46?
- Perform a new scan to see what **probe requests a client is sending**, which can reveal the names of networks it’s looking for:

bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w scan --manufacturer --wps --band abg

- The output shows the **STATION MAC** and the probe requests.  

| BSSID | STATION | PWR | Rate | Lost | Frames | Probes |
|-------|---------|-----|------|------|--------|--------|
| ...   | 78:C1:A7:BF:72:46 | ... | ... | ... | ... | wifi-*******, ***** |

- **Important:** We do not give the full probe name here. In this challenge, the answer is formatted as `wifi-***`.  
- The `wifi-***` notation is used to **mask the actual name** while still showing the correct format. The goal is to **identify the network pattern without revealing sensitive info**.  

---

### 04. What is the ESSID of the hidden AP (MAC F0:9F:C2:6A:88:26)?
- Hidden networks do not broadcast their ESSID. To identify them, we can **brute-force likely names** using a wordlist (`rockyou` in this case) and a common prefix (`wifi-`):

bash
cat ~/rockyou-top100000.txt | awk '{print "wifi-" $1}' > ~/wifi-rockyou.txt

- Then run the brute-force attempt with `mdk4`. We specify the target MAC and the generated wordlist:

bash
airmon-ng start wlan0  # activate monitor mode
iwconfig wlan0mon channel 11  # monitor the target channel
mdk4 wlan0mon p -t F0:9F:C2:6A:88:26 -f ~/wifi-rockyou.txt  # attempt to reveal ESSID

- **Why we use `wifi-` prefix:** The AP names in this lab or challenge follow a pattern (`wifi-` + word). Using the prefix helps narrow down the possibilities **without revealing the real network name**.  

---

**Summary of why we’re doing all this:**  
- Find the **channel** of target networks to monitor them.  
- Identify **MAC addresses** of clients and access points.  
- See **probe requests** to learn what networks clients are searching for.  
- Reveal **hidden ESSIDs** safely using brute-force patterns.  

All of this is basic Wi-Fi recon, helping you understand how networks and clients interact before moving to further testing.
