## Cyber Security Nordic Companies I Met

### Intel 471
- **Type:** Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) platform
- **Focus:** Adversary behavior, underground actor networks, malware, vulnerabilities, and credentials.
- **Highlights:**
  - Emphasis on high-quality intelligence sources: *“We are your window into the cyber underground.”*
  - Provides early warnings of threats.
- **Services:**
  - Adversary intelligence
  - Vulnerability & pre-exploit intelligence
  - Malware intelligence & infrastructure monitoring (including underground forums, credential marketplaces, leaked data)
  - Finished intelligence reports

### SSH
- **Focus:** Privileged Access Management (PAM), secure file transfers, SSH key management, and quantum-safe encryption for data in transit.
- **Pros:**
  - Future-proofing with quantum-safe encryption and dynamic access
  - Long heritage in SSH / secure shell protocols

### Arctic Wolf
- **Type:** Managed Detection & Response (MDR) / Security Operations provider
- **Services:** Monitoring, detection, response, 24×7 SOC service

### Universal Radio Hacker — SDR tutorial (quick workflow)
- Open URH (Universal Radio Hacker) and the spectrum/spectrogram analyzer view.
- Sweep the spectrum and pick the correct signal.
- Center the view on the carrier and start recording / capturing the first sample (I/Q file).
- Inspect the capture in time-domain and spectrogram views to find the bursts you care about.
- Pick a modulation type that visually matches the bursts 
- Choose a candidate symbol/bit length so that **message length ≈ bit-length × number of bits** 
- To find correct tolerance values (timing tolerance, pause threshold, short/long cutoff) you must **experiment** — change tolerance, re-decode and compare results across multiple captures.
- (Optional hardware step) “Flash” transmitting device microcontroller 
- now you are ready to emulate the device

### Decode 433.92 MHz weather station data
- **Device:** Weather station transmitter operating at **433.92 MHz**.
-  recorded, analyzed and emulated the wireless signal using an RTL2832-based USB SDR dongle and Universal Radio Hacker (URH).
- **Modulation:** ASK / OOK (Amplitude Shift Keying / On-Off Keying).
- **Typical timings:** ≈ **500 µs** pulse lengths (measure in URH for exact value on your capture).
- **Outcome:** Full signal decoded; protocol reproducible with:
  - Arduino + 433 MHz transmitter module (e.g., FS1000A), or
  - Transmit via SDR (HackRF, etc.) with correct I/Q waveform.

---

### Decoding ASK / OOK / PPM signals 

#### 1. Capture (I/Q) or live RF
- Record I/Q with your SDR or use live RTL-SDR input.

#### 2. Load into URH
- Use URH "File → Open" to load the I/Q file.
- Inspect the signal in time domain and spectrogram.
- 

#### 3. Pre-process
- Switch to **spectrogram** view and apply a **bandpass filter** narrowly around the carrier to reduce noise.

#### 4. Choose demodulation
- Select **ASK** modulation type and make sure that pause threshold is 0
- Set an initial **bit/symbol length** based on measured pulse widths.
- Set a **tolerance** (start small) and a **pause/reset threshold** (long gap between frames).


#### 5. Extract decoded payloads
- Apply the decoding chain and inspect binary/hex output for each frame.
- Label repeated frames and verify consistency across multiple presses or transmissions.

#### 7. Verify with automated decoder
- Run the decoder with the custom spec and inspect outputs across multiple captures.
- Tweak timings and tolerance until decoding is consistent.

# Listening to the ISS

I decided to listen to something interesting and tracked the ISS’s location using [this dashboard](https://live.ariss.org/dashboard/esamap/). I picked two points that might be in range when it passes over **California** or **Hawaii**.

- **Frequency:** 145.800 kHz  
- **Mode:** FM

- It missed Hawaii, but California was in the right spot.
- I caught a few spikes at the start, but it was silent for the rest of the time, so I didn’t get any screeshot of with a huge spike. Still, 

## SDR Setup

I selected the **Wessex WebSDR**:

- **Location:** Historical Kingdom of Wessex, South West UK  
- **QRA Locator:** IO80QR  
- **Administered by:** G8JNJ  

- I picked this SDR because I understand the language.
- I managed to hear someting
- just to listen directly through my headphones.
