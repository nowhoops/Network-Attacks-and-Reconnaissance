First things firts
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

next we need to get go translator so we can run the evilginx2

sudo apt install golang

next we need to do a git clone
git clone https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2.git
cd evilginx2
make
cd build   
./evilginx

sudo ./bin/evilginx -p ./phishlets

 
(source sudo ./bin/evilginx -p ./phishlets
)


To make an actual attack wiht the tool I would need to make a phislet and in yamal and there isn' that much good documentation free to get. there is the 
tuorial that costs 400$ which i wount do
Also we don't have a virtual envirometn to try this with.
I was planing on doing attack on my own homeassistant instace but strugled to find information sources that I trust

so no did not success
b)
decompressing the .xz file
xz -d  mininet-lab.ova.xz

Extracting the tar
tar -xvf mininet-lab.ova
I desided to use the  virt-manager so I neede to convert the vmdk to qcow2 file format 
qemu-img convert -O qcow2 mininet-s2-disk1.vmdk mininet_lari.qcow2

open the virt-manager make a new vm with the qcow2 file

Loged into the mininet and with command 
ip a 
checked the IP
the keyboard is us and did now what the hustle 
I ssh into the vm
ssh mininet@192.168.122.99

Task was to make a Mininet and perform tcp-syn flood attack.
step 1 
Make a mininet
download mininet
sudo apt-get install mininet
Make the mininet instance with two hosts h1 amd h2 and a s1 switch
sudo mn -c
sudo mn --topo single,2 --mac --switch ovsk --controller=default

configure the the network
could not figure out what was the problem could not get the devices to ping each other.
Asked copilot with my logs and it figured that h1 had 255.0.0.0 insted of the 255.255.255.0 that was h2

h1 ifconfig h1-eth0 10.0.0.1/24 up
h2 ifconfig h2-eth0 10.0.0.2/24 up

tested that with 
h1 ping h2

h1 will host a http.server in port 80
mininet> h1 python3 -m http.server 80 &
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) .

testing that connections work (PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

I did it few times and it almost chrashed my small laptop. but resoult is that non of the packets returned cause it was so overwelmed

# H5
## synflood and Evilginx2

# a) 

## Summary
**Objective:** Prepare the environment, attempt to explore Evilginx2, and build a Mininet topology to demonstrate a TCP SYN load test.  
**Outcome:** Evilginx2 exploration was not completed due to limited documentation and lack of a safe test environment. Mininet was successfully configured after fixing a subnet mask error, and the TCP SYN load experiment showed how connections can be overwhelmed.

---

## Part A: System Update and Evilginx2 Exploration

### System Update and Go Installation
- **Update:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
- **Go compiler:**
```bash
  sudo apt install golang`
```
### Evilginx2 Project (high-level description)
- **Project retrieval:** Evilginx2 was gitcloned compiled locally.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2.git
cd evilginx2
Make
cd build
./evilginx

```
- Phishlets creation: The hardest part was finding clear documentation on how to write custom phishlets in YAML format. Most guides are either incomplete or assume prior knowledge.

- Configuration details: There is little free material explaining how to properly configure phishlets for different services. The official repository provides only basic examples.

- Advanced tutorials: A comprehensive tutorial exists but costs around $400, which I did not purchase. Without it, the learning curve is steep.

- Testing environment: I lacked a dedicated virtual sandbox to safely test Evilginx2, which limited experimentation.
-  initially thought about attempting a phishing scenario against my own hardware as a controlled test. However, this would have required significant effort with a tool that does not provide ready-to-use solutions. For example, Microsoft 365 has prebuilt phishlets available, but I did not want to go that route.
- Phishlet creation starts wiht:
```bash
sudo ./bin/evilginx -p ./phishlets
```


---

## Part B: Mininet Virtual Environment Setup

### OVA Extraction and Disk Conversion
```bash
- **Decompress `.xz`:** `xz -d mininet-lab.ova.xz`
```
- **Extract OVA:** `
 ```bash
 tar -xvf mininet-lab.ova
```
- **Convert VMDK → QCOW2:**  
```bash
qemu-img convert -O qcow2 mininet-s2-disk1.vmdk mininet_lari.qcow2
```

### Virtual Machine Setup
- **Create VM:** Using virt-manager with the QCOW2 disk image.
- **Check IP:**
```bash
ip a
```
- **SSH login:** `
```bash
ssh mininet@192.168.122.99
```

---

## Part C: Mininet Topology and Connectivity Tests

### Installation and Topology
- **Install Mininet:**

sudo apt-get install mininet
```
- **Topology:**
```bash
sudo mn --topo single,2 --mac --switch ovsk --controller=default
```
- Two hosts (h1, h2) and one switch (s1).
- Cleanup before start:
```bash
sudo mn -c
```

### Fixing Configuration Error
- **Issue:** h1 had the wrong subnet mask (255.0.0.0), while h2 had the correct one (255.255.255.0).
- **Fix:**  
  - `h1 ifconfig h1-eth0 10.0.0.1/24 up`  
  - `h2 ifconfig h2-eth0 10.0.0.2/24 up`
- **Ping test:** h1 → h2 succeeded.  
- Example: 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, rtt min/avg/max ~0.095/1.311/4.190 ms.

### HTTP Server and Connectivity
- **Start HTTP server on h1:** `python3 -m http.server 80 &`  
 

---

## Part D: TCP SYN Load Test Observations 

### Purpose
- **Goal:** Demonstrate how sending a large number of TCP SYN packets can overload a target host and affect its ability to respond.

### Command Used
On host **h2**, the following command was executed to generate SYN traffic toward host **h1** on port 80:
```bash
h2 hping3 -S -p 80 -i u10 10.0.0.1
```
```bash
853836 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
--- 10.0.0.1 hping statistic ---
248005 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.0/0.0/0.0 ms

--- 10.0.0.1 hping statistic ---
185163 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.0/0.0/0.0 ms
```
- **Interpretation:** The target was overwhelmed and unable to process requests,he impact of SYN flooding.
