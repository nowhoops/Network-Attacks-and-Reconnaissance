#### NFC ja RFID

---

### a) Examine the RFID products you use and consider how well you are protected against RFID skimming.
My bank cards are stacked, and I use an RFID-blocking wallet. I tested it and confirmed that none of the cards can be read through the wallet.

I also have an RFID card that opens our laundry room, which is very vulnerable, but since everyone already has keys and can access it anytime, it doesn’t really matter.

The model of the NFC tag is very easy to copy and clone onto a new blank card.”

### b) Tutustu APDU-komentojen rakenteeseen (voit käyttää tekoälyä tutustumiseen)

**APDU commands** (Application Protocol Data Units) are used for communication between a smart-card reader and a smart card.

**Command APDU** (sent by the reader) contains:
- **CLA** – command class  
- **INS** – instruction code  
- **P1**, **P2** – parameter bytes  
- **Lc** – length of command data (optional)  
- **Data** – command data (optional)  
- **Le** – maximum expected length of response data (optional)

**Response APDU** (sent by the card) contains:
- **Data** (optional)  
- **SW1 SW2** – status bytes, `90 00` = success

### c) Research and tell what interesting RFID hacking news you found

**Hardware Backdoor Discovered in RFID Cards Used in Hotels and Offices Worldwide**

Researchers discovered that certain MIFARE Classic-series RFID cards (e.g., FM11RF08S) contain a hardware-level backdoor that allows the card's *sector keys* to be broken and the card cloned in just minutes — even if user-specific keys were originally configured.  
Sources: The Hacker News, TechSpot, The Cyber Express

This means that the security of such cards is effectively compromised: anyone who knows or extracts the backdoor key mechanism can create a clone of the card and use it like the original.

These vulnerable cards are used worldwide in hotels and corporate access control systems.

### DEF CON 32 – Unsaflok: Hacking Millions of Hotel Locks  
*By Lennert Wouters & Ian Carroll*  
System affected: **Dormakaba Saflok**  
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cx0RUV7i0s

#### Background
- Saflok/Dormakaba systems are among the most widely used hotel lock technologies worldwide.  
- Installed on approximately **3 million doors**, in **13,000 properties**, across **131 countries**.  
- The locks rely on **MIFARE Classic**, a technology known for cryptographic weaknesses.

---

### Summary and Conclusions

- Reading a single card allows opening any door at that property with the saflok locks      .  
- This system had been vulnerable since 1988.  
  - The magstripe cards were using the same format.  
- Many elements of these systems have not been fully scrutinized, and additional vulnerabilities may exist.  
- The cost of secure cards has decreased significantly in recent years.  
- Overall, the researchers had a positive experience disclosing the vulnerability to Dormakaba.
