#### NFC ja RFID

---

### a) Tarkastele käytössäsi olevia RFID-tuotteita, mieti miten hyvin olet suojautunut RFID-urkinnalta?

My bank cards are stacked and I use an RFID-blocking wallet.

Here is proof that stacking cards would be enough.

### b) Tutustu APDU-komentojen rakenteeseen (voit käyttää tekoälyä tutustumiseen)

**APDU commands** (Application Protocol Data Units) are used for communication between a smart-card reader and a smart card.

**Command APDU** (sent by the reader) contains:
- **CLA** – command class  
- **INS** – instruction code  
- **P1**, **P2** – parameter bytes  
- **Lc** – length of command data (optional)  
- **Data** – command data (optional)  
- **Le** – maximum expected length of response data (optional)

**Response APDU** (sent by the card) contains:
- **Data** (optional)  
- **SW1 SW2** – status bytes, `90 00` = success

### c) Tutki ja kerro minkä mielenkiintoisen RFID-hakkerointi-uutisen löysit

**Hardware Backdoor Discovered in RFID Cards Used in Hotels and Offices Worldwide**

Researchers discovered that certain MIFARE Classic-series RFID cards (e.g., FM11RF08S) contain a hardware-level backdoor that allows the card's *sector keys* to be broken and the card cloned in just minutes — even if user-specific keys were originally configured.  
Sources: The Hacker News, TechSpot, The Cyber Express

This means that the security of such cards is effectively compromised: anyone who knows or extracts the backdoor key mechanism can create a clone of the card and use it like the original.

These vulnerable cards are used worldwide in hotels and corporate access control systems.

### DEF CON 32 – Unsaflok: Hacking Millions of Hotel Locks  
*By Lennert Wouters & Ian Carroll*  
System affected: **Dormakaba Saflok**  
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cx0RUV7i0s

#### Background
- Saflok/Dormakaba systems are among the most widely used hotel lock technologies worldwide.  
- Installed on approximately **3 million doors**, in **13,000 properties**, across **131 countries**.  
- The locks rely on **MIFARE Classic**, a technology known for cryptographic weaknesses.

### Summary and Conclusions

- Reading a single card allows opening any door at that property.  
- This system had been vulnerable since 1988.  
  - The magstripe cards were using the same format.  
- Many elements of these systems have not been fully scrutinized, and additional vulnerabilities may exist.  
- The cost of secure cards has decreased significantly in recent years.  
- Overall, the researchers had a positive experience disclosing the vulnerability to Dormakaba.
