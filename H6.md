###### WiFi

# B) 
- During recent exercises in Wi‑Fi security challenges, I observed and attempted tasks that I had previously only seen demonstrated by others. This was my first time actively performing the steps myself, rather than following along passively.

### Key Learning
- The most significant realization was how difficult it is to piece together all the steps without direct guidance.  
- While tutorials and demonstrations make the process look straightforward, executing each stage independently requires more training for me.  
- My best friend in these exercises was **trial and error**: I often had to repeat commands, adjust configurations, and troubleshoot unexpected errors.  
- If I were to repeat these tasks again, I would likely struggle almost as much as the first time. The process is not yet intuitive, and the sequence of actions is easy to lose track of.  
- However, I believe that with repetition, the workflow will become more natural. As the saying goes: *the third time is the charm*.  

I have also never used **“wacker”**.

It was somewhat easy to brute‑force WPA3, which I did not expect.

# C) 
I haven’t trusted Wi‑Fi for a long time. That’s why almost everything goes through cable.  
If not, there is a good reason and precautions taken to make sure that it is not a leverage point to my network.
