## Cyber Security Nordic Companies 3 interesting companys
- These are three companies I picked, but there were so many others I could have chosen. I had amazing conversations with multiple companies and individuals.
-  Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to attend the keynotes—maybe next time!

### Universal Radio Hacker — SDR tutorial (quick workflow)
- Open URH (Universal Radio Hacker) and the spectrum/spectrogram analyzer view.
- Sweep the spectrum and pick the correct signal.
- Center the view on the carrier and start recording / capturing the first sample (I/Q file).
- Inspect the capture in time-domain and spectrogram views to find the bursts you care about.
- Pick a modulation type that visually matches the bursts 
- Choose a candidate symbol/bit length so that **message length ≈ bit-length × number of bits** 
- To find correct tolerance values (timing tolerance, pause threshold, short/long cutoff) you must **experiment** — change tolerance, re-decode and compare results across multiple captures.
- (Optional hardware step) “Flash” transmitting device microcontroller 
- now you are ready to emulate the device

### Decode 433.92 MHz weather station data
- **Device:** Weather station transmitter operating at **433.92 MHz**.
-  recorded, analyzed and emulated the wireless signal using an RTL2832-based USB SDR dongle and Universal Radio Hacker (URH).
- **Modulation:** ASK / OOK (Amplitude Shift Keying / On-Off Keying).
- **Typical timings:** ≈ **500 µs** pulse lengths (measure in URH for exact value on your capture).
- **Outcome:** Full signal decoded; protocol reproducible with:
  - Arduino + 433 MHz transmitter module (e.g., FS1000A), or
  - Transmit via SDR (HackRF, etc.) with correct I/Q waveform.

---

### Decoding ASK / OOK / PPM signals 

#### 1. Capture (I/Q) or live RF
- Record I/Q with your SDR or use live RTL-SDR input.

#### 2. Load into URH
- Use URH "File → Open" to load the I/Q file.
- Inspect the signal in time domain and spectrogram.
- 

#### 3. Pre-process
- Switch to **spectrogram** view and apply a **bandpass filter** narrowly around the carrier to reduce noise.

#### 4. Choose demodulation
- Select **ASK** modulation type and make sure that pause threshold is 0
- Set an initial **bit/symbol length** based on measured pulse widths.
- Set a **tolerance** (start small) and a **pause/reset threshold** (long gap between frames).


#### 5. Extract decoded payloads
- Apply the decoding chain and inspect binary/hex output for each frame.
- Label repeated frames and verify consistency across multiple presses or transmissions.

#### 7. Verify with automated decoder
- Run the decoder with the custom spec and inspect outputs across multiple captures.
- Tweak timings and tolerance until decoding is consistent.

# A)
# Listening to the ISS

I decided to listen to something interesting and tracked the ISS’s location using [this dashboard](https://live.ariss.org/dashboard/esamap/). I picked two points that might be in range when it passes over **California** or **Hawaii**.

- **Frequency:** 145.800 kHz  
- **Mode:** FM

<img width="934" height="535" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36217ea5-5885-4037-b28b-60b09ff58a10" />

<img width="929" height="495" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60ca5d51-49bd-4cb3-bf2e-f5e6979d6a5b" />

- It missed Hawaii, but California was in the right spot.
- I caught a few spikes at the start, but it was silent for the rest of the time, so I didn’t get any screeshot of with a huge spike. Still, 

## SDR Setup

I selected the **Wessex WebSDR**:

- **Location:** Historical Kingdom of Wessex, South West UK  
- **QRA Locator:** IO80QR  
- **Administered by:** G8JNJ  

- I picked this SDR because I understand the language.
- I managed to hear someting some conversations

# B) Testing RTL_433
- Downloaded RTL_433
- Tested it
- It is working, but can't see anyting.
- Tried multipal options.
- Few examples:
```bash
rtl_433 -vvv
rtl_433 -f 433M:435M -s 250k -vvv

```
- I tought that my stick was broken but it is not.

- Just can't get any hits atm. I don't have anyting that would use this freq

# C) Analysis

### RTL_433 Signal Analysis
**Sample File:** `Converted_433.92M_2000k.cs8`  
**Frequency:** 433.92 MHz  
**Analysis Tool:** rtl_433  
### Owerview
- It is likely that the signal originates from a **433 MHz wireless switch or smart plug**. (ISM)
- nexa does smarthome switches with "Frequency Range: System Nexa (433,92 MHz)"
- Each transmission corresponds to a **button press** on the remote control.  
- Signal contains:
  - Device model
     - KlikAanKlikUit-Switch
     - Proove-Security
     - Nexa-Security
- device info: Varies per model:
   - KlikAanKlikUit uses id, Unit, Command, Dim Value.
   - Proove-Security and Nexa-Security use House Code, Channel, State, Unit, Group.
  
  - Command (On / Off)
  - Dim status and value (if available)
- Each pulse is very short (~0.08 seconds) and may repeat if the button is pressed multiple times.
- same unit/house code (8785315)

### Observations
- likely from a universal RF transmitter or smart hub that sends the same OFF command to multiple compatible devices at once.

# D) Too complex
- Task is to convert file "HackRF-20250411_183354-433_92MHz-2MSps-2MHz.complex16s" to cs9 format
- Used csdr to convert the file to cs8
```bash
csdr convert_s16_f < Recorded-HackRF-20250411_183354-433_92MHz-2MSps-2MHz.complex16s \
| csdr convert_f_s8 > output.cs8

```
- To analyze it 

```bash
rtl_433 -r output.cs8 

```

- Contains GT-WT2 sensor transmissions
- Id 4 is that spesific device.
- CHECKSUM message received correctly
- nothing other interesting
  
# URH
- Installing the URH
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel \
  python3-numpy python3-psutil python3-pyqt5 \
  git g++ cython3

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jopohl/urh.git
cd urh

python3 -m pip install . --break-system-packages

urh
```
- Used the Recorded-HackRF-20250411_183354-433_92MHz-2MSps-2MHz(1).complex16s file from the previous task.

# Analysis
- With autodetect parameters go this.

- Seems to be right
- Time for the whole recording is 5.43
- With demodulation it looks like this
