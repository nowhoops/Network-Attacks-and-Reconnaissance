First things firts
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

next we need to get go translator so we can run the evilginx2

sudo apt install golang

next we need to do a git clone
git clone https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2.git
cd evilginx2
make
cd build   
./evilginx

sudo ./bin/evilginx -p ./phishlets

 
(source sudo ./bin/evilginx -p ./phishlets
)


To make an actual attack wiht the tool I would need to make a phislet and in yamal and there isn' that much good documentation free to get. there is the 
tuorial that costs 400$ which i wount do
Also we don't have a virtual envirometn to try this with.
I was planing on doing attack on my own homeassistant instace but strugled to find information sources that I trust

so no did not success
